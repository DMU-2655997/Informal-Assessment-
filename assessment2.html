<h1 style= "color: White;">Hi, I'm Luke</h1>


<p style= "color: White;">This site is all about me, rather vein I know, but hopefully it won't be too boring to read. Anyway shall we get started.</p>
<!---the code is first chnaging all the text to white and creating a heading for the first line, and then a paragraph for the second-->

<h2 style= "color: White;font-size: 30px">Who am I?</h2>
<p style= "color: White;">Im eighteen years old, and studying media production at De Montford university.
  its an enjoyable course that gives a wide range of topics to study. Im also a huge film and music nerd (seriously you can shut me up about it).
  I play guitar in my spare time and have aspirations to form a band in the future. I also love comedy and re-watch shows such as Blackadder and Fawlty Towers constantly.
</p>
<!---the code is doing a very similar command here, however the main difference is heading two is also being told to chnage the font size -->
