<p>This site is all about me, rather vein I know, but hopefully it won't be too boring to read. Anyway shall we get started.</p>
<!---creating the introdution heading and the first paragraph-->

<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Im eighteen years old, and studying media production at De Montford university.
  its an enjoyable course that gives a wide range of topics to study. Im also a huge film and music nerd (seriously you can shut me up about it).
  I play guitar in my spare time and have aspirations to form a band in the future. I also love comedy and re-watch shows such as Blackadder and Fawlty Towers constantly.
